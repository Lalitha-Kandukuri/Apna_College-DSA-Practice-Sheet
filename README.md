# 34-Day DSA Practice Sheet

Welcome! This is a 34-day Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice plan inspired by the [Apna College DSA Practice Sheet](https://www.apnacollege.in/dsa-practice-qs). Each day focuses on a set of topics for systematic learning and practice. Let's code smart! üöÄ

###  How This Works

- Each **day** introduces a focused **topic/theme** followed by a curated list of **practice problems**.
- Problems are organized by **difficulty**‚Äîranging from Easy to Hard‚Äîto ensure progressive mastery.
- Use this sheet to guide your **consistent daily practice**, track progress, and cover essential DSA patterns in just over a month. Happy learning! ‚ú®
